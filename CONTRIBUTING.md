# Contributing

First of all, **thank you** for contributing!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews and merging:

- ensure that your changes work :-)
- write documentation for new features
- use [commit messages that make sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

One may ask you to [squash your commits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) too. This is used to "clean" your pull request before merging it (we don't want commits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).

When creating your pull request on GitHub, please write a description which gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.
